[1.0] GETTING STARTED:

	[1.1] Compiling the source
	(NOTE - This step is only for those who are interested in modifying 
	the source code. The program can be run by simply double-clicking
	the 'snaykuu.jar' file)

	If you have ant installed:
		Using your terminal, navigate to the 'snaykuu' folder
		and run the command 'ant jar'. This compiles the code
		be executed either by double-clicking it or running
		and creates an executable jar file, which can then
		'ant run'.

	[1.2] Compiling your bots
	If you don't have ant installed:
		Navigate to the directory where your snaykuu.jar is located, and then run 
		this command:
		  > javac bot/*.java -cp snaykuu.jar

	If you have ant installed:
		Using your terminal, navigate to the 'snaykuu' folder
		and type 'ant bot'. Your bots are now compiled.
		
	[1.3] Programming your bot
	The essence of writing a SNAYKUU bot is simple. Your bot is a java class implementing
	the interface Brain, requiring a single method called getNextMove. This method will
	be called once each tick of the game, and is basically where you calculate in which
	direction you want your snake to move next. Each tick you are given a GameState
	object, which is a detailed representation of the current state of the game, also
	containing several useful methods to assist you in the coding process. 
	
		Much more detailed information can be found in the API (either in the doc/ subfolder
		or at <http://svinto.dsv.su.se/doc>)


[2.0] USING THE APPLICATION:

	[2.1] Starting SNAYKUU
	Start the program by either double-clicking 'snaykuu.jar', navigating
	to the snaykuu directory and running 'java -jar snaykuu.jar' in a 
	terminal, or by running the 'ant run' command if you have ant installed.

	[2.2] The main menu
	When you first start SNAYKUU, you will see two lists in the middle of 
	the screen; 'Snakes in game' and 'Available snakes'. 'Available snakes'
	contains a list of all the compiled classes implementing the 'Brain'
	interface. By double clicking the name of a bot in the 'Available snakes'
	list, you can add/remove it to the game. When you want to start the game,
	press the 'Start' button.

	[2.3] The 'Game settings' tab
	In the 'Game settings' tab you can manually select which settings you want
	to play with. These are your options:
		Board width 	The width of the game board, in squares.
		Board height 	The height of the game board, in squares.
		Pixels per square 
				The size of each square, in pixels.
		Fruit goal
				 The number of fruits each snake has to eat in
				 order to win the game.
		Fruit freq.
				 The frequency with which new fruits appear on
				 the game board. '5' means that a new fruit
				 spawns every five ticks.
		Growth freq.
				 The frequency with which snakes grow. '5' means
				 that snakes grow every five ticks.
		Thinking time
				 The amount of time (in ms) each brain has to
				 decide on its next move.
		Game speed
				 The amount of time (in ms) that will elapse
				 between each 'tick'. Decrease to make the game
				 appear to move faster, and vice versa.
				 NOTE: It is recommended that this is set to at least 
				 thrice the value of 'Thinking time'.
	
	[2.4] Replays
	After a game has been played, you are given the option to save a replay
	of the game at hand to be able to view later. If you want to view a saved
	replay, simply click Replay tab, click the "Load an old replay and play it!"
	button, and use the built in file browser to find your .srp replay file.
	Note that replays saved in older versions may not be compatible wth your
	current version.

	[2.5] Developer mode
	In the developer mode, you can run any number of 'simulated' games much faster
	than running them individually with graphics. To use dev mode, begin by
	selecting the participating snakes in the snake selection screen. Then,
	navigate to the 'developer' tab, select the number of games you want to be
	simulated, and then click 'Run test games'. The program will freeze for a while
	while the simulations are running. When it is done, a menu will pop up containing
	statistics and data from the simulations.


[3.0] IN- AND POST-GAME:

	[3.1] The game board
	This screen is fairly straight-forward. The snakes show up on the screen, ready
	to rumble! Fruit objects will occasionally show up on the board, and it is up
	to the snakes to reach them and devour them.

	[3.2] The score board
	On the right hand side of the game board is a live-updated score board of the
	current round. Snakes are shown, identified by name and color, together with
	the number of fruits they have eaten and the number of turns they have survived.

	[3.3] The post-game window
	After a game has finished, a new window displaying the results of the game will
	pop up, together with some options. The score board will be nearly identical
	to the one that is shown during the game, showing the scores of all the snakes
	as well as their placement in the round. Together with this, four buttons
	will appear; 'New game', 'Rematch', 'Save replay' and 'Exit'. This is what they
	do:
		New game	Brings you to the original snake selection menu.
		Rematch		Immediately starts a new round using the same snakes
				and game settings.
		Save replay	Allows you to save a replay of this game. See [2.4].
		Exit		Exits the application.
